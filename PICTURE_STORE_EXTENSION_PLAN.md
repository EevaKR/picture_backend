# Extending Backend for Picture Store API

## Current Foundation Strengths
✅ User authentication system
✅ JWT-based security
✅ MongoDB database setup
✅ Express.js framework
✅ TypeScript implementation
✅ Proper project structure

## Required Extensions for Picture Store

### 1. Image Model & Schema
```typescript
// src/models/Image.ts
interface IImage {
  _id: string;
  filename: string;
  originalName: string;
  mimetype: string;
  size: number;
  uploadDate: Date;
  userId: string; // Reference to user who uploaded
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  url: string;
}
```

### 2. File Upload Middleware
- **Multer** for handling multipart/form-data
- **Sharp** for image processing/resizing
- **File validation** (size, type restrictions)

### 3. Storage Options
**Option A: Local Storage**
- Store files in `/uploads` directory
- Serve via Express static middleware

**Option B: Cloud Storage**
- AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary
- Better for production/scalability

### 4. New API Endpoints Needed
```
POST   /images/upload     - Upload new image
GET    /images           - Get user's images (paginated)
GET    /images/:id       - Get specific image
PUT    /images/:id       - Update image metadata
DELETE /images/:id       - Delete image
GET    /images/public    - Get public images
POST   /images/:id/share - Make image public/private
```

### 5. Additional Features to Consider
- **Image thumbnails** generation
- **Image compression** for web optimization
- **Search functionality** by tags/description
- **Image categories/albums**
- **Image sharing** between users
- **Download tracking**
- **Image metadata** extraction (EXIF data)

### 6. Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "multer": "^1.4.5",
  "sharp": "^0.32.0",
  "@types/multer": "^1.4.7",
  "aws-sdk": "^2.1400.0", // if using S3
  "cloudinary": "^1.40.0" // if using Cloudinary
}
```

### 7. Database Schema Updates
- Add Image collection
- Possibly add Albums/Categories collection
- Add image references to User model

### 8. Security Considerations
- **File type validation** (only allow images)
- **File size limits** to prevent abuse
- **Virus scanning** for uploaded files
- **Rate limiting** on upload endpoints
- **User storage quotas**

## Implementation Priority
1. Fix existing authentication issues first
2. Add Image model and basic CRUD operations
3. Implement file upload with local storage
4. Add image serving endpoints
5. Implement image processing (thumbnails, compression)
6. Add advanced features (search, sharing, etc.)
7. Consider cloud storage migration

## Estimated Development Time
- **Basic image store**: 2-3 days
- **Full-featured system**: 1-2 weeks
- **Production-ready**: 2-3 weeks (including testing, optimization)
